				<h2>Welcome to my personal portfolio!</h2>
				<p style="text-align: left">
				<div style="text-align: left; padding-bottom: 2%;">
					Sixty-four thousand users and counting. What I originally envisioned as just a casual summer
					Discord bot project for collecting characters from shows in a trading card fashion, garnered
					more attention than what me and the team I led could ever expected.
				</div>
				<div style="text-align: left; padding-bottom: 2%;">
					I love to build, to create, to make something my very own from nothing. I have loved the craft
					of engineering since the times I could pick up a wooden block. Throughout my experiences with
					drag-and-drop programming as a child and more powerful programming languages like Java and
					Python, I have found that Computer Science is the most accessible way to engineering projects in
					our modern world. Regardless of identity, status, or environment, an internet connection unlocks
					access to the world’s most powerful toolkit.
				</div>
				<div style="text-align: left; padding-bottom: 2%;">
					Now, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Texas A&M to advance my current
					mostly self-taught understanding and go on to build bigger and better projects. Specifically
					within Computer Science, I am interested in Data Science and Cybersecurity. I have just
					completed my first semester with a 4.0/4.0 GPA in the Engineering Honors Program.
				</div>
				<div style="text-align: left; padding-bottom: 2%;">
					Highlight of Experiences:

					<li>Published a scientific peer-reviewed paper in the journal Solar Energy that detailed the
						transformation of the solar cell material double perovskite to halve the costs of solar
						panels and entirely eliminate toxic byproduct production</li>
					<li>Designed an AI model that predicts computational fluid dynamic simulations set-up which
						would cut back thousands of dollars and hours for training. Research paper currently under
						review. </li>
					<li>Assembled sample machine learning model and standardized benchmarks at MSBAI that was
						responsible for a critical part of developing the AI agent GURU. This service was later
						selected by the U.S. Air Force for the $1 million contract AFWERX Small Business Innovation
						Research Phase II Contract. </li>
					<li>Conducted and cleanly compiled thorough, efficient, and timely due diligence research at
						MicroVentures which supported many successful offerings on the platform such as Sila
						Nanotechnologies which raised $655 thousand within 24 hours.</li>
				</div>

				<div style="text-align: left;">
					I am currently seeking an internship for summer of 2022 in the fields software engineering, data
					science, or cybersecurity. Please let me know if I could be a potential candidate! I would love
					to chat in greater detail.

					<h3>Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulation Artificial Intelligence Model</h3>
					<p style="text-align: left;"> Developed artificial intelligence model that generates settings for
						non-expert users
						which removes technical barrier and saves an average of $10,000 per project
						Constructed standardized benchmarks to compare Auto Machine Learning model prototypes.
						The project was chosen by the U.S. Air Force for the $1 million AFWERX Small Business
						Innovation Research contract collaborated on project progress and provided weekly update to the
						team working with
						core engineers to trouble shoot
						Built machine learning model from scratch for the example data set as another standard
						for the comparison of the AutoML models</>

					<h3>Double Perovskite Solar Cell Material</h3>
					<p style="text-align: left;">Theoretically compressed Double Perovskites A2BB'X6 to improve
						performance as a solar cell
						material
						Decreased the bandgap of crystals by up to 35%, largely increasing the viability of these
						crystals to be used as solar cell materials
						Discussed the preparation of an environmentally friendly material as a solar cell material
						to reduce pollution from solar energy production.
						Condense key information from 300+ academic articles in ten weeks
						Published in the journal Solar Energy hosted on Elsevier with a 5.742 impact factor score
						and 4 citations in 2 years</p>

					<h3>Hackathon Projects</h3>
					<p style="text-align: left;">
						I attended HowdyHack 2021 and won the Best UI Award in which I was responsible for programming
						the main logic and core mechanics of the game.
						I have also participated in TAMUDatathon 2021 as well as TAMUHack 2022. Through the hackathons,
						I have dove deep and learned about web development, Python GUI management, and graphical data
						analysis.

					<h3>CodePath TechFellow</h3>
					<p style="text-align: left;">
						I was selected by CodePath to be a TechFellow in teaching a ten-week introduction to
						cybersecurity course emphasizing on web vulnerabilities.
						The course's structure as well as vast availability for help many students with absolutely no
						experience to make that most difficult first step into the field.
						I lead efforts in diligently preparing course material to ease students into difficult and
						abstract concepts.
						The team of four tech fellows marketed course that helped increase the total applications to
						over 100+ students
						Some topics we cover are: IDOR, Sessions, XSS, SQL Injection, Crypto, User Authentication</p>

					<h3>Cybersecurity Capture The Flag (CTF) Competitions</h3>
					<p style="text-align: left;">
						These competitions are gamified cybersecurity exercises that involve competing (often in teams)
						to find flags hidden behind
						various insecure infrastructure that may exist among many of our digital devices if not
						mitigated properly.
						Although I am only a Freshman, I have competed in numerous CTF competitions and have been
						awarded high rankings.
